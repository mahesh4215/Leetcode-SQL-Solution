The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
  
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
  
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

solution: MYSQL

select t.Request_at as Day, round(sum(case when t.Status != 'completed' then 1 else 0 end)/count(*),2)
as 'Cancellation Rate'
from Trips t
where t.Client_Id in (select Users_Id from Users where Banned ='No')
and t.Driver_Id in (select Users_Id from Users where Banned = 'No')
and t.Request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
group by t.Request_at;


Solution: MSSQL Server

SELECT 
    t.request_at AS Day, 
    ROUND(
        CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN t.status IN ('cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
        AS FLOAT) / COUNT(*), 2
    ) AS [Cancellation Rate]
FROM Trips t
JOIN Users c ON t.client_id = c.users_id AND c.banned = 'No'  
JOIN Users d ON t.driver_id = d.users_id AND d.banned = 'No'  
WHERE t.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'  
GROUP BY t.request_at
ORDER BY t.request_at;
