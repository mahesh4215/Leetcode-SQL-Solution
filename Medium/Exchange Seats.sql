Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+


Solution: 
  
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id + 1 <= (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;

Explanation: 
  
Direct Swap Logic:
directly compare id + 1 with the maximum ID in the table. This ensures swaps occur only when the next ID exists.
For odd IDs, add 1 (id + 1) if it's within the range.
For even IDs, subtract 1 (id - 1) to swap with the previous row.
Leave the ID unchanged if no swap is needed (e.g., last row in an odd-length list).
