Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Input: 
Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
Output: 
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+

Solution: using round and case statement.
SELECT
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating * 1.0 / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) * 100.0 / COUNT(query_name)
    , 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name
Order by quality desc;
